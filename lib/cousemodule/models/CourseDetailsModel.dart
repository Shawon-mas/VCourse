It is common for graduate students and faculty to write about their research in journals and at conferences. The number of research or journal papers that are published has also become a key factor in determining whether someone is given a job or not. Some of the best universities in the world are now making it more and more difficult for people to get a doctorate if they don&#39;t write about their research in SCI-indexed journals. Unfortunately, despite the fact that many people write and publish research papers, most universities don&#39;t offer formal training or help on how to write good papers. Graduate students and young researchers have had a hard time organizing and structuring their papers for publication because they don&#39;t have the help and resources they need. If you are a graduate student, are doing research, are trying to get a job, or want to get better at your job in science, technology, or academia, this class is for you. If you don&#39;t know how to start your research paper, you won&#39;t have to spend a lot of time thinking about how to do it. If you are a beginner, you can just follow along with the simple steps for outlining each part of your paper. Even if you are an experienced researcher, you might be surprised at how much you can learn from the strategies and examples in the course videos. Instructor Research Profile: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mdmehedi-Hassan-2 It&#39;s time to take this Writing Research Papers course now. You&#39;ll learn how to write a good research paper.

/// description : "<p><strong>Over the last decade,</strong> there has been a big rise in the expectation that research papers should be published in academia, in professional communities, and in science and technology fields all over the world. It is common for graduate students and faculty to write about their research in journals and at conferences. The number of research or journal papers that are published has also become a key factor in determining whether someone is given a job or not. Some of the best universities in the world are now making it more and more difficult for people to get a doctorate if they don&#39;t write about their research in SCI-indexed journals. Unfortunately, despite the fact that many people write and publish research papers, most universities don&#39;t offer formal training or help on how to write good papers. Graduate students and young researchers have had a hard time organizing and structuring their papers for publication because they don&#39;t have the help and resources they need. If you are a graduate student, are doing research, are trying to get a job, or want to get better at your job in science, technology, or academia, this class is for you. If you don&#39;t know how to start your research paper, you won&#39;t have to spend a lot of time thinking about how to do it. If you are a beginner, you can just follow along with the simple steps for outlining each part of your paper. Even if you are an experienced researcher, you might be surprised at how much you can learn from the strategies and examples in the course videos. Instructor Research Profile: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mdmehedi-Hassan-2 It&#39;s time to take this Writing Research Papers course now. You&#39;ll learn how to write a good research paper. In the near future, this class will be completely reworked to cover the most up-to-date web-based tools and scholarly resources that can be used to do research and write high-quality papers.</p>"
/// requirments : "<p>There is no need to have written a research or technical paper before. This course is equally good for people who have never done research before and for people who have do<strong>ne some research before and want to write better research papers.</strong></p>"
/// forwho : "<p>1. Doctoral or Master&#39;s level students 2. New faculty members who are expected to write about their work in professional publications, such as journals and proceedings. 3. Researchers in business who have to write technical papers 4. Any young scholars who haven&#39;t written journal or technical papers before.</p><ul><li>hhhh</li><li>ggggg</li></ul>"
/// what_will_learn : "<p>1. Improve your scientific research skills by being familiar with the best practices for completing a project. 2. Prepare a successful research paper for publishing in a scientific journal, archival volume, or other professional publications by learning just how to do it. 3. These tactics and ideas can help you write an award-winning pape<strong>r that effectively conveys your findings.</strong></p>"
